Create day2-minibuild/agent.py that solves the SAME task agent-style:

- Same course client, plain import: from common.llm import chat, STATS (no sys.path tricks).
- Define exactly three plain Python tool functions (all file paths resolved relative to the script file itself):
  read_notes() -> returns the text of notes.txt (next to the script)
  count_items(text) -> returns how many action items appear in the given text (implement as a simple line/bullet count)
  save_output(text) -> writes text to agent_output.txt (next to the script) and returns "saved"
- System prompt: give the model the GOAL (produce the action-item list with owner/deadline and MISSING flags, the flagged gaps, and a 3-sentence summary), describe the three tools, and tell it to reply each turn with either
  ACTION: tool_name(arguments)   or   DONE: <final answer>
- Make the reply parsing FORGIVING: models add flourishes. Tolerate case differences (Action:/action:), extra whitespace, conversational preamble before the keyword, and markdown code fences around it. Search for the keyword anywhere in the reply instead of using a rigid startswith check.
- The loop: send the conversation, parse the reply; on ACTION run that tool and append the result to the conversation; on DONE (or after a maximum of 8 turns) stop. If a reply contains neither keyword, append a reminder of the protocol and count it as a turn. We have not covered real tool calling yet, so this simple text protocol is intentional.
- At the end, print the final answer, the number of turns used, and STATS.
