# Build Challenge 2 — Context & Prompt Design (50 pts, due Fri Jul 17, 11:59 PM CT)

**Objective.** Deliberately induce a context-window failure on a multi-step
task (drift, forgotten instructions, or overflow), then fix it using
techniques from the pre-read (compaction, just-in-time retrieval,
note-taking, system-prompt altitude). Document what broke, what you changed,
and evidence it's fixed.

**Starter state.** `overload_task.py` stuffs 30 policy documents into one
request when only 3 matter — including expired/rescinded look-alike policies
with different numbers. Run it a few times and capture the failure — wrong
citations (the AS-12/AS-27 traps), invented provisions, ignored
instructions, or overflow. Strong models sometimes survive it; if yours
does, reproduce the failure with a smaller model
(`COURSE_MODEL="gemma4-small" python3 bc2-context/overload_task.py`) —
which is itself the lesson: context robustness varies by model, and your
fix must not depend on the model being heroic. Note the starter's token
cost either way (~25k tokens per question!) — your fix should crush that.

**Your fix** goes in `fixed_task.py` (you create it). Keep the starter intact
as the "before" so the comparison is honest. Any strategy from the pre-read
is fair game; retrieval can be keyword-based (OpenRouter has no embedding
model — that constraint is real and worth noting in your write-up).

**Prompts are software artifacts.** The analyst prompt lives in
`prompts/bc2-analyst.txt`. Every change you make to it (and any prompt you
add) gets a `PROMPTS.md` entry; your write-up must cite **at least two**
entries as evidence of the fix.

**Acceptance check.**
- A documented failure from the starter (output + why it failed).
- `python3 bc2-context/fixed_task.py` answers with exactly AS-7 / AS-18 /
  AS-24 and correct details, at a fraction of the starter's token cost
  (compare `STATS`).
- ≥2 cited `PROMPTS.md` entries.
