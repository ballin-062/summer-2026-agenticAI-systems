# Build Challenge 3 — Reliability & Rollback (50 pts, due Tue Jul 21, 11:59 PM CT)

**Objective.** Start from the provided broken-agent skeleton: diagnose its
failure modes, then add retries, timeouts, fallbacks, and a harness with a
rollback path. Your agent must checkpoint to disk and **survive a Codespace
stop/restart mid-task** — demonstrate recovery from that interruption and
from at least one injected failure.

**Starter state.** `broken_agent.py` processes `requests.jsonl` and usually
"succeeds" — while hiding at least six reliability flaws (the docstring lists
the categories; find them in the code).

**Protocol.**
1. **Diagnose before fixing.** List every flaw you find and the bad day that
   triggers it (network blip, chatty model reply, crash mid-run, restart…).
2. Build `fixed_agent.py`: timeouts + retries with backoff, JSON validation
   with a fallback path, staged output with rollback (never destroy the last
   good report), and a checkpoint file so a restart resumes where it left off
   without re-spending tokens.
3. **Demonstrate recovery twice:** (a) kill/stop the Codespace mid-run and
   show it resumes correctly; (b) inject one failure (e.g., point BASE at a
   bad URL for a few items, or corrupt a model reply) and show the harness
   handles it and the report stays valid.

**Acceptance check.** Both recovery demos captured in the write-up — an
**asciinema recording is the preferred evidence** (`asciinema rec
bc3-recovery.cast`, commit the .cast file; trace excerpts or screenshots
also accepted) — report never left corrupt/half-written, and re-running
after success is idempotent.

**Rubric (50 pts).** Diagnosis completeness (15) · fixes: retries/timeouts/
validation/fallback (15) · checkpoint + rollback with demonstrated recovery
(15) · Build Journal entry (5).
