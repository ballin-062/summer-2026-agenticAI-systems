# Runs on EVERY container start (called from scripts/gateway-daemon.sh, the
# devcontainer postStartCommand) and is safe to run by hand at any time:
#     bash scripts/env-setup.sh
#
# What it guarantees for every terminal in this Codespace:
#   1. PYTHONPATH includes the repo root, so `from common.llm import chat`
#      works from ANY folder — no sys.path tricks needed in student code.
#   2. The shell prompt shows where you are relative to the repo root,
#      e.g. "repo/day2-minibuild $".
#   3. Each new terminal prints a 3-line banner: where you are, where to
#      build, and how to run your program.
#
# Idempotent: it replaces its own marked block in ~/.bashrc on every run,
# so re-running (or pulling an updated version) always leaves exactly one
# up-to-date copy.
